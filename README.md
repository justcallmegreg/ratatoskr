__Ratatoskr__ is a library written in Python to make the development of AWS Lambdas easier and more secure. It supports implementing "singleshot" operations that can be reached from an AWS Lambda function and validating the input parameters to avoid unnecessary boilerplate for argument checking. 

## How to use?

### Protect arguments

```python

from ratatoskr import protectron
from ratatoskr.schema import SchemaValidationError


def is_int(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise SchemaValidationError
    return n


@protectron(is_int)
def multiple_by_two(num):
    return 2 * num


multiple_by_two(42) ====> 42
multiple_by_two("42") ====> Exception: SchemaValidationError("expected int for data['num']"

```

### Dispatch event

```python

from ratatoskr import register_operation, dispatch_event


@register_operation
def return_me(a):
    return a


@register_operation
def return_24():
    return 24


### AWS Lambda handler
def handler(event, context):
    return dispatch_event(event)


### Example event and handler call

example_event = {
    'operation': 'return_me',
    'args': {
        'a': 42
    }
}

handler(exampe_event, context)  ===> returns 42

another_example_event = {
    'operation': 'return_24',
    'args': {}
}

handler(another_example_event, context)  ===> returns 24
```

## Installation

The package has not been deployed to `pip` yet.
You can install it by:

* cloning the repository and run `pip install -t .`
* __OR__ run `pip install git+https://github.com/ngergo/ratatoskr.git`

## Tests

__Writing tests is good!__ They protect you from doing things you don't want... It's not different at `ratatoskr`. Tests are written using `pytest` and run via `tox`.
`tox` also checks for style using `flake8` and does code coverage report using `coverage`.

* Run `tox` command in the root directory of the project to run all the tests. 
* You can specify which interpreters should be used by `tox -e [pyX.X]`
* Read more about [__tox__](https://testrun.org/tox/latest/)

PR's for testing new cases is always welcome!

### Contribute

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.

  - Use ``tox`` command to run all the tests in all locally available python version.
* Install `pre-commit` via `pip install pre-commit` then `pre-commit install`.
* Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :).
